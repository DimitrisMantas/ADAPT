## ABOUT

**ADAPT** is an open-source Python 3 software package for the optimization of building energy consumption and human
comfort using state-of-the-art genetic algorithms coupled industry standard whole building performance simulation
software.

**ADAPT** was originally developed for the electric power and natural gas business unit of MYTILINEOS S.A., one of the
largest independent industrial conglomerates and electricity producers in Greece, under the direct supervision of Dr. 
Vassilis Nikolopoulos, Head of Applied Research & Development.

The core of **ADAPT** is made up of two distinct modules: (i) a simulation and (ii) an optimization engine. The former
module is based on a custom implementation of the NSGA-II algorithm, while the latter on EnergyPlus and OpenStudio.
