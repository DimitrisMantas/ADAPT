## ABOUT

**ADAPT** is an open-source Python 3 module for the optimization of building energy consumption and human comfort using 
genetic algorithms coupled with whole building performance simulation software.

**ADAPT** was originally developed for the electric power and natural gas business unit of MYTILINEOS S.A., under the
supervision of Dr. Vassilis Nikolopoulos, Head of Applied Research and Development.

**ADAPT** consists of two distinct modules: an optimization and a simulation engine. The former is based on the NGAII
algorithm, while the latter is based on EnergyPlus and OpenStudio.

Insisting on an open-source design philosophy, **ADAPT** comes bundled with EnergyPlus™, a whole building performance
simulation engine developed and under direct funding from the United States Department of Energy. However, this engine
can - with some effort - be swapped out for another similar computer program, as long as it features a Python 3 API and
can produce the required simulation data.
